CHANGES IN RITOOLS VERSION 0.1-12

* Switched to base graphics instead of the lattice package for balance
  plots.
* Option to make plots on absolute, instead of signed, values.
* Added the ability to include tooltips to balance plots when using
  the RSVGTipsDevice package.
* Added a `balanceplot` function to handle plotting matrices, not just
  `xbal` objects.
* Balance plots can be grouped into related variables. By default
  factors are automatically grouped for `xbal` objects.
* Some performance improvements when certain results are not requested.
* `post.alignment.transform` argument to `xBalance` allows modifying
  the data after per-stratum centering.
* `subset` method for `xbal` objects.

CHANGES in RItools v. 0.1-11

NEW FEATURES
* the null SD of the difference in adjusted means is now reportable as
  "adj.means.diffs.sd"
* report="all" provides all relevant statistics
* Entering "args(xBalance)" is now useful as a reminder of report=
  options.

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT
* The default imputation method for missing data is the median. Before
  0.1-9 it was the mean. To use the mean, use impfn=mean.default.
* Passing strata=NULL to xBalance is depracated, as it can be easy to
  do inadvertently, with a misspelling of a non-null intended
  argument.  For no stratification, use list(unstrat=NULL), as is now
  the default.

BUG FIXES
* display, align, etc arguments to xtable.xbal() have been enabled.
* In xBalance, when specifying a stratification using a formula with
  several variables, as in "~x+y", the stratification you get is now
  interaction(x,y) rather than just y.
